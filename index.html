      <p> Welcome to my digital portfolio. Below is a little bit about me and what schools I have attended. These schools have helped me gain the technical and professional skills that are usable in a job.
      Above are my work samples and awards and honors I have created to illustrate these skills. If you wish to contact me, please do so at mstridiron.ptech@gmail.com or at my Twitter account: MattStridiron. </p>

          I am currently a junior at NFA (Newburgh Free Academy) North high school. As a school integrated with the Main Campus, I have gone to many afterschool clubs here. I have been to Math Team (2014-2018), the Student Tech Team (2017-2018), Astronomy Club (2016-2017), Varsity Cross Country (2017), the Mock Trial (2017-2018), and the National Science Honors Society (2017-2018). I am expected to graduate in 2019 with a high school diploma and math degree from North, and I am planning to meet the qualifications to get a science degree as well from North this June.

          Excelsior Academy (P-TECH) is based within NFA North. P-TECH is a separate program from the rest of the school that allows high school students to earn either an Associates Degree in Appplied Sciences or Cybersecurity at a SUNY Campus and teaches students real-world skills used in the workforce. As a student in this program, I have a larger workload than other students. I have to attend programs in the summer, take a series of college courses without an official lunch break, and work for hours every night on homework. Despite these things, my current year in high school has been the most successful school year ever.

          As part of the P-TECH program, I have been able to take networking courses at SUNY Orange every Tuesday and Thursday since 2017. Although I have 30-60 minutes of free time on these days, I have used it to explore SUNY's programs. I have gone to their math and writing labs to obtain assistance in my classes (especially in Freshman English!), and I have seen the various programs SUNY offers. In the fall semester, I even attended a Super Smash Bros. Club after class. It was a lot of fun!

      <p> <b> 1881 </b> New York City formed the Department of Sanitation. The Department of Sanitation was formed because New York City was so filthy, travlers could smell it from up to six miles away. The New York City Department of Sanitation became the first sanitation department to democratically clean and pick up litter from every street no matter what race or class the neighbor hood is. Today the Department of Sanitation is the largest sanitation department in the world.</p>

      <p> <b> 1908 </b> In 1908 dumping waste became a usual thing. Many dumped waste in the ocean or wetlands. It took the United States 25 years to set up regulations.Some cities/towns found ways to get rid of wastes for instance small farms/cites would used the technique of "piggeries". Piggeries were small pig farms that specifically consume raw and cooked food waste. It would take 75 pigs to consume about one ton of food waste.</p>
